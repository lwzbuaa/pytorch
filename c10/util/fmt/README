This is a vendored copy of the fmt library, v6.2.0.

See https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt for more info.

We use `fmt` in a header-only configuration.

The procedure for updating:
1. Download the release zip from github
2. Unzip it somewhere
3. Copy headers: `cp include/fmt/* c10/fmt/`
4. Modify c10/format.h to include what you want
